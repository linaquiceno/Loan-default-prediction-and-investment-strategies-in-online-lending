# Loan Default Prediction and Investment Strategies in Online Lending
Analysis of data from an online lending platform, call Lending Club. The goal is to develop models to predict which loans are at risk of default. Such models can then be used to devise investment strategies.

The project was split into three assignments. You will find an rmd, Html, and pdf file for each assignment. Every file has its questions and answers, but you can also read the assignment questions in the pdf files ending with the word assignment.
